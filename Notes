After preparing the playbook and templates, execute the following command to run the playbook:
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml


Note:
1)In the inventory file, remember to replace web_servers in the hosts field with the appropriate target hosts or group name
2)This playbook 'webserver.yml' will install Apache, copy the HTML content to the appropriate location, generate a self-signed SSL certificate, 
  configure the Apache virtual host for HTTPS, enable the redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, and restart the Apache service.
